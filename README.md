# Urobot_segmentation_DB

Urobot_segmentation_DB is a segmentation datasets for human upper-body with 7 joints; head, left shoulder, left elbow, left hand, right shoulder, right elbow, and right hand.

This dataset consists of RGB and segmentation images that depict 12 different scenarios, such as cleaning the table, preparing cereal in a bowl, reading a book, etc., with four different persons.
